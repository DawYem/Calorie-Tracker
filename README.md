# ü•ó Calorie Tracker - Weekly Meal Planner

## üìã Description

The **Calorie Tracker** is a simple C# console application that helps users track their weekly calorie intake while working toward their weight goals. It collects user input such as current and ideal weight, height, and then calculates the BMI to provide personalized feedback. For each day of the week, users select food options from various categories‚Äîmeats, vegetables, grains, and drinks‚Äîand receive a calorie total.

This project is a great starting point for individuals interested in health, nutrition, or learning how to build user-interactive console applications with data structures and basic logic in C#.
